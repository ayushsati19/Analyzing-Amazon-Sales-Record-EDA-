To build a model that can predict house prices with high accuracy, several data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques will be applied to transform the dataset into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. This will include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and performing feature selection.
Various machine learning models will be trained on the preprocessed data to predict the sale prices of houses. The performance of each model will be evaluated using suitable evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) scores.

In conclusion, this project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on the given features, which could potentially help real estate agents and homeowners in making informed decisions about property values.
